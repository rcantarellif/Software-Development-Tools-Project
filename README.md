# Software-Development-Tools-Project

This project is a tool to simulate random events. It provides a simple interface for users to simulate various types of random events, such as coin flips, dice rolls, or random number generation within specified ranges.

## Description

The Streamlit app for vehicle data analysis provides users with an interactive platform to explore insights from the "vehical_us.csv" dataset. Upon launching the app, users encounter a clear header that sets the context for analysis, ensuring a seamless navigation experience. A pivotal feature of the app is its checkbox functionality, allowing users to effortlessly switch between histogram and scatter plot views. Leveraging the Plotly Express library, the app presents visually compelling histograms and scatter plots, illuminating key trends and relationships within the vehicle dataset. By integrating intuitive design elements with dynamic visualization options, the Streamlit app facilitates informed decision-making and deeper understanding of the underlying data patterns.
